# Word sense disambiguation with Bert

This is a lab work from a course on Advanced Machine Learning for NLP.

We had to fill in a canvas provided by the professor in order to fine-tune FlauBERT for the word sense disambiguation task, training on the [ASFALDA](http://asfalda.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/frameIndex.xml) dataset.
